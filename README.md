# Background Audio Player

Background Audio Player is a Chrome Extension for playing audio in the background.

## Features

- Plays any audio files supported by Chrome including network streams.
- Keyboard shortcuts for playing, pausing, and stopping audio playback.
- Can automatically begin playing when opening your Chrome.

## Limitations

- Does not support managing a playlist of any kind. You pick one audio URL and that's all you currently get.
- Pre-play controls only. You cannot adjust the volume during playback, etc. Such settings have to be set in options before usage. Moving some/all options to extension pop-up is planned (specifically volume, possibly URL, etc.).
